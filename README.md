## The Problem: Yield Farming is Hard

Providing liquidity to earn yield can be a complicated and expensive process. Yielder is designed to fix these common challenges:

* **Constant Monitoring:** You have to constantly watch the markets to find the best returns.
* **Time-Consuming:** Frequently moving your funds between pools to chase better yields is tedious.
* **High Complexity:** Managing investments across many different platforms (e.g., Uniswap, SushiSwap) is confusing and difficult.

## The Solution: Yielder Makes it Easy

Yielder is an automated system that handles the entire yield farming process for you:

* **Smart Analysis:** Yielder constantly analyzes performance metrics like APR, TVL, and Swap Fees to find the most profitable liquidity pools across supported DEXs.
* **Automatic Staking:** Once the best pool is found, the protocol automatically deploys your assets into it.
* **Dynamic Rebalancing:** Yielder continuously monitors the market. If a more profitable opportunity appears, it automatically moves your funds to the better pool.
* **Simple Portfolio Management:** Your entire position is represented by a single token: the **Yielder LP Token (YLP)**. This simplifies portfolio management down to tracking a single asset.
* **Shared Costs:** By managing assets collectively, the protocol socializes transaction costs, leading to greater capital efficiency for everyone involved.

## How It Works: The Yielder Lifecycle

The Yielder protocol automates the entire yield farming lifecycle through a sophisticated, multi-stage process designed to be completely hands-off for the user after the initial deposit.
## How It Works: The Yielder Lifecycle

The Yielder protocol automates the entire yield farming lifecycle through a sophisticated, multi-stage process designed to be completely hands-off for the user after the initial deposit.

![Yielder Workflow](./processes/yirlder.png)

### 1. On-Chain Analysis & Pool Discovery üìà

Yielder continuously monitors all supported liquidity pools to identify the most profitable opportunities.

* **On-Demand Analysis:** A user can call the `Best-Stake` handler with a token pair to get an immediate recommendation for the best pool.
* **Continuous Background Monitoring:** An automated cron job runs every two minutes, calling the `cronnn` handler to fetch the latest data for all supported pools, ensuring the system's information is always up-to-date.
* **Metric Calculation:** It calculates critical performance indicators for each pool in real-time, including Total Value Locked (TVL), 24-Hour Volume, and Annual Percentage Rate (APR).

### 2. Automated Liquidity Provision üîó

Once a user decides to stake, Yielder acts as a proxy to execute the transaction on their behalf.

* The protocol takes the user's deposited tokens and programmatically calls the `AddLiquidity` function on the optimal DEX pool (either on Uniswap V3 or SushiSwap).
* The DEX pool then mints its native LP token and sends it directly to the Yielder process, which holds it in custody within its treasury.

### 3. YLP Token Abstraction üéüÔ∏è

In exchange for the deposited assets, Yielder mints and distributes its own derivative token, the **`YLP` (Yielder LP Token)**, to the user.

* The `YLP` token serves as a liquid receipt for the user's stake.
* This powerfully abstracts the investment‚Äîthe user's entire, potentially complex position is represented by this single `YLP` token, drastically simplifying portfolio management.

### 4. Continuous Optimization & Rebalancing ü§ñ

The true power of Yielder lies in its autonomous optimization engine.

* The `Auto-Yield-Optimizer` handler periodically analyzes the fresh market data.
* It compares the APR of the pool currently holding a user's funds against all other available pools for the same token pair.
* If the optimizer finds a new pool with a significantly higher APR, it automatically triggers a rebalance‚Äîwithdrawing liquidity from the underperforming pool and redeploying it into the new, higher-yielding one.

### 5. Seamless Redemption üì§

When a user wants to exit their position, the process is as simple as the deposit.

* The user calls the `burn` handler, sending their `YLP` tokens back to the Yielder process.
* Yielder calculates the user's proportional share of the underlying assets, withdraws them from the appropriate DEX pool(s), and transfers the base tokens directly back to the user's wallet.

## Protocol Architecture

### Key Processes

* **Main Yielder Contract:** The central smart contract that contains all protocol logic and also serves as the `YLP` token contract.
    * **Contract Address:** `0x1234567890123456789012345678901234567890`
* **Cron Job Contract:** A utility contract that calls the main contract's functions every two minutes to refresh data.
    * **Contract Address:** `0x0987654321098765432109876543210987654321`

### Core Assets (Yielder Token Suite)

These are test tokens used within the Yielder ecosystem for providing liquidity on Ethereum Sepolia testnet.

    ```solidity
    yielderContract.requestUSDC(10);
    ```
* **Get 20 USDT:**

```bash
Send({ 
    Target = "SpJdYt1_CdMG0W5JjDVYfu-tJNGB2bXC6usBSyrQAys",
    Action = "Best-Stake",
    TokenX = "_IxG5qxfgSBBj1wH7BL0j1vkihOcfx2ntXS19NZjDFU", -- YT1
    TokenY = "Zg8ihIkD2Tpm2E0vRbJSD0J3Jb3dqK8XUZ4OlOZ9kcc"  -- YT2

## Getting Started: A User's Guide

### Step 1: Acquire Test Tokens

Use the built-in faucet functions to get test tokens sent directly to your wallet.
* **Get 10 USDC:**
    ```solidity
    yielderContract.requestUSDC(10);
    ```
* **Get 20 USDT:**
    ```solidity
    yielderContract.requestUSDT(20);
    ```
* **Get 30 DAI:**
    ```solidity
    yielderContract.requestDAI(30);
    ```

### Step 2: Find the Best Pool to Stake In üîç
Use the `findBestPool` function to perform a live analysis and find the most profitable pool for a given pair.

```solidity
yielderContract.findBestPool(
    0x94a9D9AC8a22534E3FaCa9F4e7F2E2cfB85B5b29, // USDC
    0x7169D38820dfd117C3FA1f22a697dBA58d90BA06  // USDT
);
```

### Step 3: Stake Your Tokens üîó
First, transfer your tokens to the Yielder Process. Then, call the `Stake-User-Token` handler. The protocol will automatically stake them in the optimal pool and mint `YLP` tokens back to you.

```bash
Send({ 
    Target = "SpJdYt1_CdMG0W5JjDVYfu-tJNGB2bXC6usBSyrQAys",
    Action = "Stake-User-Token", 
    Pool = "Q9uyLNaNvuFHvNrQQZ_XuOrRZ6OEE0KqSEPJJj8Z4Ys", -- Example Pool ID from Step 2
    User = "YOUR_WALLET_ADDRESS",
    TokenXAddress ="_IxG5qxfgSBBj1wH7BL0j1vkihOcfx2ntXS19NZjDFU", 
    TokenXQuantity = "2000000000000",  
    TokenYAddress ="Zg8ihIkD2Tpm2E0vRbJSD0J3Jb3dqK8XUZ4OlOZ9kcc", 
    TokenYQuantity = "2727272727272"
### Step 3: Stake Your Tokens üîó
First, approve the Yielder contract to spend your tokens. Then, call the `stakeTokens` function. The protocol will automatically stake them in the optimal pool and mint `YLP` tokens back to you.

```solidity
// First approve the contract
IERC20(0x94a9D9AC8a22534E3FaCa9F4e7F2E2cfB85B5b29).approve(
    yielderContractAddress, 
    2000000000000
);

// Then stake
yielderContract.stakeTokens(
    0x3416cF6C708Da44DB2624D63ea0AAef7113527C6, // Pool Address
    0x94a9D9AC8a22534E3FaCa9F4e7F2E2cfB85B5b29, // USDC
    0x7169D38820dfd117C3FA1f22a697dBA58d90BA06, // USDT
    2000000000000,  // USDC Amount
    2727272727272   // USDT Amount
);
```
### Step 4: Withdraw Your Assets üì§
To exit your position, simply call the `burn` function with your `YLP` tokens. The protocol will automatically withdraw the underlying assets from the DEX and return them to your wallet.

```solidity
yielderContract.burn(ylpTokenAmount);
```
